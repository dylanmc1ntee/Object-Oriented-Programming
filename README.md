# Object-Oriented Programming - Fall 2024

## Collection of Work

This repository contains my work for **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** at UCF during the **Fall 2024** semester. It includes various Java assignments and projects that demonstrate my progression in **object-oriented design**, **data structures**, and **algorithm implementation**.

## Assignments

### Assignment 1: Store Receipt Generator
- **Description:** A program that generates a store receipt with randomly generated dates and receipt numbers. It allows users to input item names and prices while applying tax rules for specific items.
- **Key Concepts:**
  - User Input Handling (Scanner)
  - Random Number Generation (Random Class)
  - String Manipulation and Formatting
  - Conditional Logic and Loops

### Assignment 2: Dice Rolling Simulation
- **Description:** A simulation of rolling two dice 1000 times, storing the frequency of each outcome, and displaying a graphical representation of the results.
- **Key Concepts:**
  - Object-Oriented Design with `Dice` and `Die` Classes
  - Encapsulation and Class Interaction
  - Simulating Probability with Randomization
  - Data Storage and Frequency Counting

### Assignment 3: Linked List Manipulation
- **Description:** A linked list implementation that reads from a file, processes data by applying conditions, and outputs a modified list to a new file.
- **Key Concepts:**
  - Custom `Node` and `LinkedList` Classes
  - File Input/Output (BufferedReader, FileWriter)
  - Dynamic Memory Allocation in Java
  - Iterating and Modifying Linked Lists
